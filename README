Greetings from the 2001 O'Reilly Open Source Conference
in San Diego. We've spent a lot of time polishing this
and making it work. We're pleased to call it BETA
software, and we think it basically works, but YMMV. Please
send your thoughts, comments, questions, bug reports, and
most of all, your patches. Thanks.

This is ALPHA software. It does not conform completely
to the NoCat spec, it has no documentation, and it is
intrinsically insecure. However, it does somewhat
function, with a good bit of tweaking. Don't use it.
Have a nice day. :)
