NoCat Authentication v.0.40 
===========================

The software has been largely written by Schuyler Erle, with
a herculean amount of motivation and assistance from Rob
Flickenger. Moral support and testing effort has been provided
by Nate Boblitt, Jim Rosenbaum, and Adam Flaherty, who also
did a lot of work on the look and feel of the auth service.
Additional testing help was provided by Rich Gibson, and Terrie
Miller provided us with the original design for the website.

We hope NoCat Auth helps you provide unlimited bandwidth
everywhere for free.

Release Notes:
==============

08/12/2001

The NoCat Auth distro has come a long way. We've got a live
authentication service up and running; you can find it at
http://nocat.net. Almost all of the functionality from the
original white paper spec has been implemented; at this point,
the major feature still in an experimental state is the
per-service-class bandwidth shaping. It's still Beta, but it
seems to work pretty well for us. We hope it'll work for you,
too, and we hope you'll let us know if does. (And if it doesn't 
we hope you'll send patches and not flames... :-)

Greetings from the 2001 O'Reilly Open Source Conference
in San Diego. We've spent a lot of time polishing this
and making it work. We're pleased to call it BETA
software, and we think it basically works, but YMMV. Please
send your thoughts, comments, questions, bug reports, and
most of all, your patches. Thanks.

This is ALPHA software. It does not conform completely
to the NoCat spec, it has no documentation, and it is
intrinsically insecure. However, it does somewhat
function, with a good bit of tweaking. Don't use it.
Have a nice day. :)
