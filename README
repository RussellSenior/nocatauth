The software has been largely written by Schuyler Erle, with a
herculean amount of motivation and assistance from Rob
Flickenger.  Moral support and testing effort has been provided by
Nate Boblitt, Jim Rosenbaum, and Adam Flaherty, who also did a
lot of work on the look and feel of the auth service. Additional
testing was provided by Terry Schmidt and Rich Gibson. Rich has also
submitted significant documentation patches. Terrie Miller provided
us with the original design for the website.

We hope NoCat Auth helps you provide unlimited bandwidth
everywhere for free.

Release Notes:
==============

09/24/2001 (v0.51)

Open Portal mode is now fixed for browsers that return odd http header data. 
This caused a 'looping' issue where users couldn't escape the splash page in
some circumstances.

Also, the magical "ANY" group can now provide member class access to any
member of any group.  Specify ANY in the TrustedGroups directive of the
nocat.conf (or leave it blank) and members of any group will be accepted
into the co-op class.

Oops.  Quick bugfix: the revised NoCat.pm wasn't checked into 
v0.43 (it was a laaaaaaate nite.)  It's all better now.

Support for Open portal mode is now included.  Set the 
"GatewayMode" directive to "Open" in the nocat.conf on your
gateway, and it will display a simple splash page rather than
connect to the auth system.  Set it to "Captive" for regular
Captive portal mode.

Largely a maintenance release, with a new firewall feature:
IncludePorts and ExcludePorts (see INSTALL and sample
nocat.conf for details).

Also Fixed the DNSAddr specification bug, added some port
forwarding examples in etc/, an init script, and more
documentation.  Yes, we're still Beta, but getting better 
all the time!

The NoCat Auth distro has come a long way. We've got a live
authentication service up and running; you can find it at
http://nocat.net. Almost all of the functionality from the
original white paper spec has been implemented; at this point,
the major feature still in an experimental state is the
per-service-class bandwidth shaping. It's still Beta, but it
seems to work pretty well for us. We hope it'll work for you,
too, and we hope you'll let us know if does. (And if it doesn't 
we hope you'll send patches and not flames... :-)

Greetings from the 2001 O'Reilly Open Source Conference
in San Diego. We've spent a lot of time polishing this
and making it work. We're pleased to call it BETA
software, and we think it basically works, but YMMV. Please
send your thoughts, comments, questions, bug reports, and
most of all, your patches. Thanks.

This is ALPHA software. It does not conform completely
to the NoCat spec, it has no documentation, and it is
intrinsically insecure. However, it does somewhat
function, with a good bit of tweaking. Don't use it.
Have a nice day. :)
