Release Notes:
==============

02/13/2002 (v0.76)

Well, this release was a bit overdue. Included:

* Passive mode support: Like Captive mode, but intended to work even behind
    NATs. Broken still, insecure, completely beta, don't use it yet, but here
    it is.

* nocat.conf has been split into gateway.conf and authserv.conf, per Sameer 
    Verma's recommendation. The relevant file installs as $PREFIX/nocat.conf
    depending on what you're installing.

* Open mode now supports favicon.ico type icons. Thanks to Michael Codanti for 
    the patch.

* Expiration of client connections based on disappearance from the ARP cache.
    Based on a patch from Michael Codanti.

* AllowWebHosts directive now supports "friendly" websites that clients may
    visit without first logging in. Good for linking to your community's
    homepage from your splash page, etc. Thanks to the PersonalTelco folks
    for the idea.

* Many bug fixes and other whatnot. Try it. You'll love it.

Enjoy. SDE

Big update:

* Pluggable authentication sources: NoCatAuth now (theoretically)
  supports any kind of dynamic firewall.

* ipchains support (and a start on ipfilter support)

* User auth code rewritten

* LocalGateway can now be defined in nocat.conf.  This means 
  that you too can run the Auth system and a Gateway on the same
  Machine!  (not that we'd recommend it, but so many people asked
  for it, so here you are.  =)

Forgot to export ANY in NoCat.pm.  Fixed.

Open Portal mode is now fixed for browsers that return odd http header data. 
This caused a 'looping' issue where users couldn't escape the splash page in
some circumstances.

Also, the magical "ANY" group can now provide member class access to any
member of any group.  Specify ANY in the TrustedGroups directive of the
nocat.conf (or leave it blank) and members of any group will be accepted
into the co-op class.

Oops.  Quick bugfix: the revised NoCat.pm wasn't checked into 
v0.43 (it was a laaaaaaate nite.)  It's all better now.

Support for Open portal mode is now included.  Set the 
"GatewayMode" directive to "Open" in the nocat.conf on your
gateway, and it will display a simple splash page rather than
connect to the auth system.  Set it to "Captive" for regular
Captive portal mode.

Another quick maintenance release.

Largely a maintenance release, with a new firewall feature:
IncludePorts and ExcludePorts (see INSTALL and sample
nocat.conf for details).

Also Fixed the DNSAddr specification bug, added some port
forwarding examples in etc/, an init script, and more
documentation.  Yes, we're still Beta, but getting better 
all the time!

The NoCat Auth distro has come a long way. We've got a live
authentication service up and running; you can find it at
http://nocat.net. Almost all of the functionality from the
original white paper spec has been implemented; at this point,
the major feature still in an experimental state is the
per-service-class bandwidth shaping. It's still Beta, but it
seems to work pretty well for us. We hope it'll work for you,
too, and we hope you'll let us know if does. (And if it doesn't 
we hope you'll send patches and not flames... :-)

Greetings from the 2001 O'Reilly Open Source Conference
in San Diego. We've spent a lot of time polishing this
and making it work. We're pleased to call it BETA
software, and we think it basically works, but YMMV. Please
send your thoughts, comments, questions, bug reports, and
most of all, your patches. Thanks.

This is ALPHA software. It does not conform completely
to the NoCat spec, it has no documentation, and it is
intrinsically insecure. However, it does somewhat
function, with a good bit of tweaking. Don't use it.
Have a nice day. :)
