###### authserv.conf -- NoCatAuth Authentication Service Configuration.
#
# Format of this file is: <Directive> <Value>, one per
#   line. Trailing and leading whitespace is ignored. Any
#   line beginning with a punctuation character is assumed to
#   be a comment.

###### General settings.
#
# Log verbosity -- 0 is (almost) no logging. 10 is log
#   everything. 5 is probably a safe middle road.
#
Verbosity       10

##
# PGPKeyPath -- The directory in which PGP keys are stored.
#   NoCat tries to find this in the pgp/ directory above
#   the bin/ parent directory. Set this only if you put it
#   somewhere that NoCat doesn't expect.
#
# PGPKeyPath	/usr/local/nocat/pgp


###### Authservice-specific settings.
#
# HomePage -- The authservice's notion of a default
#   redirect.
#
HomePage	http://nocat.net/

# DocumentRoot -- Where all of the application templates (including
#   SplashPage) are hiding. Can be different from Apache's DocumentRoot.
#
DocumentRoot	/usr/local/nocat/htdocs

##### Authservice authentication source.
#
# DataSource -- specifies what to authenticate against.
#   Possible values are DBI, Passwd, LDAP, RADIUS, PAM, Samba.
#
DataSource	DBI

##
# Auth service database settings.
#
# If you select DataSource DBI, then Database, DB_User, and DB_Password
#   are required.
#
# Database is a DBI-style data source specification.
#
Database	dbi:mysql:database=nocat
DB_User		nocat
DB_Passwd	whodatatmydo?!


## LDAP support. Requires Net::LDAPi & IO::Socket::SSL to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# If you select DataSource LDAP, all of the following settings are required:
#
#    LDAP_Host - DNS name or IP Address of LDAP directory
#    LDAP_Base - the LDAP container for searching and creating users
#    LDAP_Admin_User - the fully distinguished name of the administrative user
#	NOTE: this user must be able to create users in the container specified above
#    LDAP_Admin_PW - the admin users password
#    LDAP_Hash_Passwords - Yes or No
#       - if passwords are to be MD5 hashed before being set in the directory
#    LDAP_Search_as_Admin - Yes or No
#       - "Yes" if all operations are to be done as the admin user, "No" if
#	    everything but creation should be done as anonymous
#
# This version of LDAP.pm has been updated and tested against a Novell eDirectory
# LDAP server.  The login "unique ID" - the e-mail address - is stored as an
# attribute of the user, and the "name" provided by the user is used as the
# directory object name.
#
# Please send bug reports and patches.
#
# Still with this release, the admin tools don't fully work with LDAP support at
# the moment.
#
# LDAP_Host		ldap.mydomain.com
# LDAP_Base		ou=myContainer,o=universe
# LDAP_Admin_User	cn=LDAPAdmin,o=universe
# LDAP_Admin_PW		ldapAdminSecret
# LDAP_Hash_Passwords	Yes
# LDAP_Search_as_Admin	Yes

## RADIUS support. Requires Authen::Radius to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# Right now, this support is totally experimental. Please send bug reports
# and patches. The admin tools don't fully work with RADIUS support at the moment.
#
# RADIUS_Host	radius.nocat.net
# RADIUS_Secret	sHHHH

## PAM support. Requires Authen::PAM to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# Make sure you have an /etc/pam.d/nocat or nocat line(s) in your /etc/pam.conf.
# See etc/pam.conf from this distribution for an example. The PAM_Service
# directive controls which PAM service NoCat attempts to authenticate against,
# but we don't recommend changing it unless you really know what you're doing
# with PAM. It defaults to "nocat". The admin tools don't work with PAM support
# at the moment.
#
# PAM_Service	nocat

## Samba support. Requires Authen::Smb to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# Samba_PDC and Samba_Domain are required. Samba_BDC is optional.
#
# Samba_Domain	MyWorkgroup
# Samba_PDC	MyPrimaryDomainController
# Samba_BDC	MyBackupDomainController

## Alternately, you can use the Passwd data source. 
#
# UserFile	    /usr/local/nocat/etc/passwd
# GroupUserFile	    /usr/local/nocat/etc/group
# GroupAdminFile    /usr/local/nocat/etc/groupadm
#
# The format of these files is as follows:
#
# In UserFile, each line is of the form <username>:<password>, where the
#   password is an MD5 digest of the user's actual password.
#
# In GroupUserFile and GroupAuthFile, each line is of the form 
#   <group>:<user1>,<user2>,<user3>,...
#
# The UserFile may be updated with the bin/admintool script included in this
# distribution.

###### Auth service user table settings.
#
# UserTable names the table containing the user ID data.
#
# UserIDField names the column containing the ID that the
#    client uses to uniquely identifying themselves, i.e. their
#    e-mail address or username.
#
# UserPasswdField stores the user's MD5-hashed password.
#
# UserAuthField is deprecated and will go away.
#
UserTable	Member
UserIDField	User
UserPasswdField Pass
UserAuthField   Status
UserStampField	Created

GroupTable      Network
GroupIDField    Network
GroupAdminField Admin

####### Auth service web application settings.
#
# MinPasswdLength -- Enforced minimum user password length.
#   Not much other checking is done on the user's p/w.
#
MinPasswdLength	6

# MessageSign -- shell command to sign an auth notification
#   with. The message to be signed is written to the
#   command's standard in, and the signed message is read
#   from standard out.
#
# GpgPath	/usr/bin/gpg
#
# MessageSign	$GpgPath --clearsign --homedir=$PGPKeyPath -o-

# LocalGateway -- If you run auth service on the same subnet 
#   (or host) as the gateway you need to specify the hostname 
#   of the gateway. Otherwise omit it.  (Requires Net::Netmask)
#
# LocalGateway    192.168.1.7

# Auth service template names. See the individual templates
#   for details on what each one does.
