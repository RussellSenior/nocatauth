###### authserv.conf -- NoCatAuth Authentication Service Configuration.
#
# Format of this file is: <Directive> <Value>, one per
#   line. Trailing and leading whitespace is ignored. Any
#   line beginning with a punctuation character is assumed to
#   be a comment.

###### General settings.
#
# Log verbosity -- 0 is (almost) no logging. 10 is log
#   everything. 5 is probably a safe middle road.
#
Verbosity       10

##
# PGPKeyPath -- The directory in which PGP keys are stored.
#   NoCat tries to find this in the pgp/ directory above
#   the bin/ parent directory. Set this only if you put it
#   somewhere that NoCat doesn't expect.
#
# PGPKeyPath	/usr/local/nocat/pgp


###### Authservice-specific settings.
#
# HomePage -- The authservice's notion of a default
#   redirect.
#
HomePage	http://nocat.net/

# DocumentRoot -- Where all of the application templates (including
#   SplashPage) are hiding. Can be different from Apache's DocumentRoot.
#
DocumentRoot	/usr/local/nocat/htdocs

##### Authservice authentication source.
#
# DataSource -- specifies what to authenticate against.
#   Possible values are DBI, Passwd, LDAP, RADIUS.

DataSource	DBI

#   are required.
#
# Database is a DBI-style data source specification.
#
Database	dbi:mysql:database=nocat
DB_User		nocat
DB_Passwd	whodatatmydo?!

## LDAP support. Requires Net::LDAP to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# If you select DataSource LDAP, LDAP_Host and LDAP_Base are required.
#
# Right now, this support is totally experimental. Please send bug reports
# and patches. The admin tools don't fully work with LDAP support at the moment.
#
# LDAP_Host	ldap.nocat.net
# LDAP_Base	...

## RADIUS support. Requires Authen::Radius to be installed from the CPAN.
#
# Right now, this support is totally experimental. Please send bug reports

#
# UserFile	    /usr/local/nocat/etc/passwd
# GroupUserFile	    /usr/local/nocat/etc/group
# GroupAdminFile    /usr/local/nocat/etc/groupadm
#
# The format of these files is as follows:
#
# In UserFile, each line is of the form <username>:<password>, where the
#   password is an MD5 digest of the user's actual password.
#
# In GroupUserFile and GroupAuthFile, each line is of the form 
#   <group>:<user1>,<user2>,<user3>,...
#
# The UserFile may be updated with the bin/admintool script included in this
# distribution.

#    client uses to uniquely identifying themselves, i.e. their

# UserPasswdField stores the user's MD5-hashed password.
#
# UserAuthField is deprecated and will go away.
