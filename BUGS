Known Bugs:

* File locking in Passwd mode authentication is broken, race condition and so forth. Ho hum.

Oddments:

* IncludePorts and ExcludePorts are only for TCP ports.  Should there be
  "IncludeUDPPorts", "IncludeTCPPorts", etc?  For that matter, what about
  separate rules for Co-op members?

* Groups are really poorly defined, and not represented by first class objects in
  storage.
