Ready but untested:

* Test gateway behind NAT with port forwarding

Tentative TODO list (more or less in order of importance):

* Better error reporting from gateway to authservice during notification.

* DOCS

* rc script to start bin/gateway? and load kernel modules!!!

* Sanity checking of timeout values, etc. Esp. try to prevent g/w from blocking forever.

* Setuid firewall script wrapper (in C)

* Ping timeout option (instead of or in addition to repeating SSL auth)

* User-definable timeout option

* Apply for SSL cert

* User management tools

* Auth service initiated authentication
