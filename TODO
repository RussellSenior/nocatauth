Tentative TODO list (more or less in order of importance):

* User mgmt tools, including admin interface & "Forgot my password" mailer.

* Better error reporting from gateway to authservice during notification.

* "Open Portal" gateway mode

* Group managment tools

* Group membership filtering on the gateway

* DOCS

* Sanity checking of timeout values, etc. Esp. try to prevent g/w from blocking forever.

* Setuid firewall script wrapper (in C)

* Ping timeout option (instead of or in addition to repeating SSL auth)

* User-definable timeout option

* Apply for SSL cert

* Auth service initiated authentication
