Ready but untested:

* Test gateway behind NAT with port forwarding

* Test owner lists

* Spiffy up bin/access (actually support multiple classes of service)

* Add firewall rules for DNS

* Better checking of ConfigFile locations and directive sanity

Tentative TODO list (more or less in order of importance):

* Better expiration of auth tokens (to avoid multiple login confusion and potential resource attack).

* Better error reporting from gateway to authservice during notification.

* More configurable logging for bin/gateway

* DOCS

* rc script to start bin/gateway? and load kernel modules!!!

* Sanity checking of timeout values, etc. Esp. try to prevent g/w from blocking forever.

* Setuid firewall script wrapper (in C)

* Ping timeout option (instead of or in addition to repeating SSL auth)

* User-definable timeout option

* Apply for SSL cert

* User management tools

* Auth service initiated authentication 

* Bundle::NoCat for CPAN?
